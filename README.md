SNHU CS300

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I was solving was storing, retrieving, and displaying course information. That information being the course number, the course name, and the course prerequisites if it exists for that particular course.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The approach I used for the problem was figuring out which of the three data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary  I could implement to solving the problem.
The data structure of my choice was vectors for two reasons: (1) I've had more experience using vectors in prior courses and (2) it was the easiest choice to implement out of the three.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The one roadblocks I had were understanding both the Hash Tables and Binary Search Tree data structures when writing pseudocodes for them.
The way I overcame them was by keep referring to the zyBooks examples for further clarification.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on the project expanded my approach to designing both software and programs by relying on pseudocode for guideance when I get lost on how
to design certain functions within my code. Pseudocodes can be reliable in a sense of establishing an idea on how to set up the code.

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project has taught me to establish a well documented code with comments giving a break down on how te code works. I made sure to establish a while loop
as a menu with options to select which function I want the algorithm to perform. On top of that, this project has taught me to tackle one thing at a time focusing on the small
steps before moving on to the next.
